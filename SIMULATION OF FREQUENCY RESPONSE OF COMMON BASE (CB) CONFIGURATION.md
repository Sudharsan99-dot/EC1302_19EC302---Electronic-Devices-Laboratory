# SIMULATION OF FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF COMMON BASE (CB) CONFIGURATION

## AIM:
To design and simulate the frequency response of a common base configuration circuit using LT-Spice.

## SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
LT-Spice

## PROCEDURE:
1.Double click on LT-Spice icon.

2.New schematic window open.

3.Pick and paste the required component from the library and draw the circuit diagram.

4.Complete the connections.

5.Right click on the components and modify the values of the components.

6.Save the file by giving file name.

7.Click on the run option  click advanced open  select AC analysis  enter the amplitude, time delay, stop time value.

8.Click on the run option  simulation window opens  place the probe  output graph is obtained.
